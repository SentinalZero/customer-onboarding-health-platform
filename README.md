# customer-onboarding-health-platform
A demo-ready SaaS system that simulates customer onboarding, tracks product usage, and calculates customer health to identify churn risk.

## Why this exists
In SaaS, customers don’t churn because the product is bad — they churn because value isn’t realized early.

This project simulates how a Solutions Engineer and Customer Success team might:
- onboard customers
- track adoption
- identify risk
- intervene before renewal is at risk

## What this demonstrates
- Pre-sales demo readiness
- Post-sales implementation logic
- Customer health modeling
- Clear communication of technical concepts

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Python (FastAPI)
- Database: SQLite
- API: REST
- Infra: Docker
